Yinyu:

The graphs I have in my homepage are rather small (only up to 500 nodes).
But I once obtained the following graph generator, called "rudy", of which 
I will send you the c files in the following two mails. They are:

gb_lib.c        basic graph algorithms of Knuth
rudy.c          generator based on that due to Giovanni Rinaldi

Compiling: gcc gb_lib.c rudy.c -lm -o rudy

Good luck and best wishes,

  Stefan

PS: Please note my new address.
